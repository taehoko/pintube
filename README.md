Q. How many hours did it take to complete?

A. 6~7 hours 

Q. Which required stories have you completed?

A. I used my own images to create a fake app "PinTube" (Pinterest + YouTube)

A. This app includes all features from the Facebook example (post view, tab bar, navigation bars, etc) 

Q. Which optional stories have you completed? 

A. I used TabBarController to make all 5 tabs clickable. 

A. "Like", "Heart", and "Star" buttons can be toggled. Each button increases/decreases the stats below the image.

A. TextField brings up the keyboard and animates with the keyboard.

A. I used NavigationController to add the title (text and image) and left * right buttons. 

A. Tapping the photo(video) shows a view controller with a full-screen video. 

Q. Open questions

A. I couldn't get "TTTAtributedLabel" work. 

A. I wanted to make the "add" tab bring up a modal screen that overlays on top of any previous screen instead of a separat e view, but I couldn't make this work. 

A. When the keyboard is shown, clicking on the photo in the background shouldn't open the full-photo view and only dismiss the keyboard. But I couldn't get this work.
